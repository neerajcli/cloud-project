# Private Cloud Image Classification using Kubernetes + HAProxy + Node-RED

This project demonstrates a **private cloud-based AI image classification system** deployed on a **Kubernetes cluster**.  
A **MobileNetV2 deep learning model** is used for image classification.  
**HAProxy** performs **load balancing** across multiple API replicas, and **Node-RED** provides a **visual workflow interface**.
